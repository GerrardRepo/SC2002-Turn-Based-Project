# SC2002 Turn Based Project
## Project Overview

This Turn-Based Project is a Java command-line game developed using object-oriented design and guided by SOLID principles to fulfill the requirements of our SC2002 coursework.

In the game, the player selects a character class, chooses a difficulty setting, and selects suitable items before battling through multiple stages of turn-based combat against either wolves, goblins or both.

The arena includes several gameplay features, such as:

- **Status effects** that can be applied to both the player and enemy units
- **Special abilities (skills)** for each character, with delays or cooldown mechanics implemented using the **Strategy Pattern**
- An **inventory system** that allows the player to gain advantages during battle.
- **Dynamic choice selection** system that only shows available actions to the user.
- and **many more**.

Overall, the project focuses on applying software engineering and object-oriented design concepts to build a functional, modular, and maintainable turn-based combat system.

For more details, please refer to the report document.
